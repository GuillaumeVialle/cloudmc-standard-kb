Single entrypoint
Explain the benefits, pros and cons

MC-8264 is a good reference

C&W has found some downsides to having separate logins for their customers.

Prerequisite:  How to deal with overlapping account names and emails.
- Will need to clean up manually

2 features to discuss:
- Single entrypoint
- Email vs name login

In C&W, every customer organization had their own login page, which to a certain extent allowed some customization, such as a logo on the login page, or a unique domain name.

But, if you were a user in one organization and needed to be given access to another organization without being upgraded to an Operator, you would need to create multiple accounts, one in each organization you needed access to.  Obviously this can become unmanageable over time.

Additionally, for Cable & Wireless the org code became a blocker because they ended up having super long domain names.

For them, a login based on username made sense, but no longer.

Incompatible with LDAP login.

Disks are storage presented to an instance as a device which can be mounted for storage.

To create, modify, or delete a disk, an account with the *User* role must be a member of the environment which contains the instance, and also have the *Editor* or *Owner* environment role assigned.  An account with the *Administrator* role or higher may create, modify, or delete disks in an environment.

To access disks, navigate to your GCP environment and click on the **Compute** tab.
